# RFC-1 - Featured Client Requirements
Authored by: ShowierData9978 <contact@showierdata.xyz> on 4/18/24 (CT).

## Terms/Definitions

- Us/We - The Meower team

## Rules
- Clients created for malicious intent will not be featured
- Clients must have their own Privacy Policy
- If your client implements any kind of plugin/addon interface, any plugins that are featured (or in the repo) are considered to be part of the client.
- The Meower Team may, at it's sole discretion, choose whether or not a client should be featured
- The Meower Team may feature a client despite not complying with this RFC

## Guidelines

### Design Practices

- Cache chat and post data
- Use Cloudlink to get updates to cached information
- You must use V1 of the WebSocket Server

### Vulnerabilities

If your client is discovered to have a vulnerability, you must fix said vulnerability as soon as possible, alert your client's users (if necessary), and have it removed from the list of featured clients if it won't be fixed in a reasonable amount of time.
